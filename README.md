**Model:** Arduino Uno (or equivalent)

**Function:** Processes input from sensors and controls the motors.

## 2)Motor Driver Shield
**Model:** L298N Motor Driver Shield (or equivalent)

**Function:** Amplifies control signals from the Arduino to drive the motors.

## 3)DC Motors (4)
**Model:** Generic DC motors with gearboxes

**Function:** Provide movement by driving the wheels.

## 4)Battery Pack
**Model:** Lithium-ion battery pack (4 cells)

**Function:** Powers the entire circuit

## 5)Ultrasonic Sensor
**Model:** HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor

**Function:** Measures distance to obstacles for navigation.

## 6)Servo Motor
**Model:** Generic SG90 Servo Motor

**Function:** Adjusts orientation or specific components of the vacuum cleaner.

## 7)DC Motor
**Model:** MorningVale EB-TOY-MTR

**Function:** To rotate the fan.
